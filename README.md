A webapp that I made for myself last summer, now hosted on github - not very useful for others

This was the work of the summer of 2013. I decided to make my first webapp for myself. I had never done this, and so I learned most of the HTML, CSS, JS from scratch. I have hosted this now as the final version. It is no longer maintained, but here as a history of the work that I did.
